## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

Write about 1-2 paragraphs describing the purpose of your project.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Say what the step will be
ensure you are in the root Directory, run the following commands in your terminal:

```
npm install
```

And repeat
The Above Command will install All depencies and packages required.
To run The Project, run the following command in your terminal:

```
npm start
```

OR

This command will also run the project, but would be automatically restarted if any changes are made to the source code, while is still running in your local Env

This automatically restarts the application whenever changes are made to the source code. this is to avoid manually restarting your server
when changes are made to the source code. 'nodemon App'.
(App) is the Entry Point to your Code

```
nodemon App
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.

## üîß Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system.

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
